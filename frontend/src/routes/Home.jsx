                        In an effort to get kids outside, this app was created
                        to capture childrenâ€™s interest and have them engage in
                        nature. Adventure Walks incorporates color exploration,
                        letter association, fun facts tailored to kids about
                        what they see in their own neighborhood, and it uses AI
                        to partner with one of the largest biodiversity
                        observatories in the world to identify plants species.
                        The mission behind Adventure Walks is to foster an
                        environment for learning while creating excitement about
                        getting kids outside.
